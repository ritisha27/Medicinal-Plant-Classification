# Medicinal-Plant-Classification
The project focuses on classifying medicinal plant leaves based on shape and size using deep learning approaches. To enhance model generalization, data augmentation was applied to introduce variety from real-world camera-captured images. Six deep CNN-based models were fine-tuned and to provide explainability GRADCAM was used to visualize the regions of the herbal leaves which influence the model's classification decisions.
